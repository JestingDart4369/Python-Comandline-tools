🧠 02_Programs

02_Programs is a collection of Python-based utility tools and learning projects.
It’s designed as a personal toolbox — combining small automation scripts, API experiments, and educational code examples — all launched from a single interactive menu.

	•	🌦 Weather Info — fetches real-time weather data for any city using the OpenWeather API￼.
	•	📚 Edubase Downloader — integrates the edubase-downloader￼ as a Git submodule.
	•	💾 Auto Installer — the setup_and_run.py script automatically installs all dependencies globally and runs the program.
